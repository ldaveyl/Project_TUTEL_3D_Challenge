

Welcome to the 7th bi-annual 3D Community Challenge. "Boss Fight" was inspired by our mutual love for video games, and the memorable boss fights that came from them. We can't wait to see what you creat this month!

As usual, the goal is to take the bare-bones 3D template, let your imagination soar, and build out a unique 3D world of your choosing. This challenge is for newcomers to 3D art, and long-time practioniors. We do these challenges to have fun, and learn and grow together as a supportive community, and in the end, all of our hard work will be put together into a couple epic montages on youtube.com/pwnisher.
Speaking of community, use my "Create With Clint" Discord server as a tool to help you through the challenge. Myself and the Moderators built out a "get started" page full of FAQ's and Guidlines" an "Announcements" page with vital information to ensure you're guided through the finsih line, and some "Working" channels as well. Every Monday we're doing virtual meetups to show off our WIPS and ask questions with myself and the mods.

PROJECT FILES
	Myself and the CWC Discord Moderators have done everything to ensure you have what you need to create. We created 3 versions of the project file for you (a Close, Medium, and Far version) to facilitate as many of your ideas as posible. Pick the one that supports your idea the best. If there are bugs in your project file, we will patch and update via a @BossFight Discord Announcement.

REFERENCES
	Viewport Exports - Just a render from the original project file to compare yours with if you're worried about something being broken.
	Example Renders - by @vzewl. Use them as a guide when you're like, "Am I breaking the rules?"

OPTIONAL MOCAP ANIMATIONS
	These are (optional) motion capture files I recorded for you to help get the ball rolling. Use them if you'd like, or create your own animations.
